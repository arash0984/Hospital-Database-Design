# Hospital Database Design Project

![Diagram 1](Diagram1.png)

This project showcases the design and implementation of a Hospital Database using SQL. It includes the following components:

- **application.c**: This file contains the C code for an application that interacts with the Hospital Database. It provides various functionalities for managing patient records, employee details, medical equipment, appointments, and billing.

- **ER Diagram.pdf**: The ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram depicts the entities, relationships, and attributes of the Hospital Database, providing a visual representation of the database structure.

- **Hospital.sql**: This SQL script file contains the SQL statements for creating the tables in the Hospital Database. It includes the necessary schema definitions and constraints for data integrity.

- **Normalization Proofs.pdf**: This document presents the normalization proofs for the Hospital Database. It explains the step-by-step process of normalizing the database tables to eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency.

- **Relational Schema.pdf**: The Relational Schema document presents the final schema for the Hospital Database. It provides a detailed overview of the table structures, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between the tables.

- **SQL Query file**: This file contains various SQL queries that demonstrate the querying capabilities of the Hospital Database. It includes sample queries for retrieving patient information, employee details, medical records, appointments, and generating billing reports.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Hospital Database project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Import the Hospital.sql file into your preferred database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

3. Compile and run the application.c file using a C compiler. Make sure to update the database connection details in the code to match your database setup.

4. Use the application's command-line interface to interact with the Hospital Database. The application provides options for adding patients, managing employees, scheduling appointments, generating reports, and more.
